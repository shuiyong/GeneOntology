run time: lin, jiang, resnik's method for getting the two gene's similarity is O(m * n * p1 * p2), where gene 1 annotates m geneontology nodes, while gene 2 annotates n geneontology nodes. p1 is the average number of parent node of gene 1's  geneontology nodes, while p2 is average number of parent node of gene 2's geneontology nodes.

run time, VICD for getting the two gene's similarity  is O(n^3) while n is the number of nodes annotated by one gene and all of their ancesters.

space complexity:
O(n) for storing the geneontolgy. And n is the number of the edges in the geneontoly.

lin, jiang, resnik's method doesn't need additional space.

VINC needs another o(m) space while m is the number of edge in the shortest path graph.
